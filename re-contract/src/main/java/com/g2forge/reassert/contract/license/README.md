In this directory are two tables the [CSV](standardlicense.csv) and the [XLSX](standardlicense.xlsx).
The Excel spreadsheet should generally be used for editing, as it includes conditional formatting which makes the process less error prone.
However, the CSV will be used as the source of truth for analysis.
