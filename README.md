# Reassert

Reassert is an OSS tool to analyze the usage of libraries and their licenses for compliance issues.
Compliance is analyzed by codifying license and usage terms in ways lawyers and programmers can agree on.
It is designed to be able to synthesize data from a wide range of sources (github, maven, npm, etc) and produce not just reports, but explanations.
